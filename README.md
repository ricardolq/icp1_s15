# Project Overview

This project contains a collection of examples and implementations designed to demonstrate various programming concepts and techniques. The examples are organized within the `src` folder, which serves as the core of the project.

## `src` Folder Content

The `src` folder includes examples that explore concepts such as recursion, iterative approaches, and backtracking. Below is an index of the examples included:

### Index of Examples
1. **01-Recursion**: Demonstrates the use of recursion to calculate the factorial of a number.
2. **02-RemoveRecursionLoop**: Shows how to calculate the factorial of a number using an iterative approach with a loop, avoiding recursion.
3. **03-RemoveRecursionStack**: Implements factorial calculation using an explicit stack to simulate recursion, avoiding the function call stack.
4. **04-Backtracking**: Solves the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm.

### Brief Explanation of Each Example
- **01-Recursion**:
  - Demonstrates how recursion can be used to solve problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems.
  - Example: Factorial calculation using a recursive function.

- **02-RemoveRecursionLoop**:
  - Replaces recursion with a loop to calculate the factorial of a number.
  - Highlights the efficiency of iterative approaches in avoiding stack overflow.

- **03-RemoveRecursionStack**:
  - Uses an explicit stack to simulate the recursive process of calculating factorials.
  - Useful for understanding how recursion works internally and for avoiding recursion-related issues.

- **04-Backtracking**:
  - Implements the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm.
  - Demonstrates how to explore all possible solutions to a problem by systematically searching through options.
